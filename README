Octo Games Metrics
This repository provides a tool to scrape game data from SteamDB and Reddit. It collects information about game subscribers, player counts, game names, and their identifiers from SteamDB. Additionally, it fetches mentions of the game from Reddit using the Reddit API. All this data is visualized in a chart for easy analysis.

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/ChewBaccaYeti/Octo_games_metrics.git

cd Octo_games_metrics

npm install

Usage
Start Proxy Server
The proxy server is used to fetch data from SteamDB and Reddit. To start the proxy server, run the following command:

npm run server

This will start the server on localhost:5000.

Start Local Development Environment
Once the proxy server is running, you can start the local development environment:

npm start

This command will start the webpack development server on localhost:9000. You can now view the dashboard in your browser.
